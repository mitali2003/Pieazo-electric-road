WORKING :
The basic principle which we use to generate electricity is the piezoelectric effect. A piezoelectric material is  
that one which converts mechanical energy or vibration energy that is experienced on it, to a charge which can  
be stored. When a force or pressure is exerted on the elastic piezoelectric crystal material, the crystal gets  
deformed and this causes it to develop charge between them and the crystal goes back to its original state. 
This charge flow is converted to a voltage that can be stored in a battery. We explain about a disc shaped  
piezoelectric buffer plate in our paper. Since the power obtained from a few of them will be in a very small  
amount, we use voltage amplifying circuits here. As the size and number of piezoelectric crystals increase, the  
energy obtained from them also increases. 
street light is controlled automatically by Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). With the help of LDRs the street  
lights are automatically switched off during day time and switched off during night time. The automatic traffic  
light control is made possible by two pair of IR transceivers placed on each road of the four-way junction. Each  
transceiver pairs are kept face to face width-wise on each road. 
When the IR signals between each of the transmitter and receiver pair gets cut proportionally according to the  
traffic density on each road, the traffic lights are controlled. This function with the help of a program stored in  
a microcontroller. Besides all these, the charging condition of the battery is sent and indicated every second to  
the nearest traffic control room.
